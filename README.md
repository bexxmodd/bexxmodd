I'm a Software Engineer at Google and Master\'s candidate in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania. In my professional career I write code for Android devices but in my personal time I work on projects with Rust and Kotlin.

Currently I'm taking Web Systems class and mastering Kotlin. I write logs about opinions, guides, and tutorials about various technologies on my [blog](https://www.bexxmodd.com/logs)

2022 Resolution is to learn Functional Programming, Kotlin, and get better hold of Android SDK.
