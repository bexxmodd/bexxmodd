Software Engineer and Master\'s candidate in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania. I work on OS projects with Rust and C++.

At work I mainly use C# and C++, less frequently Python (mainly for scripting or data analysis).

Currently I'm taking Networked Systems class. I also write logs about Rust and similar technologies on my [blog](https://www.bexxmodd.com/logs)

2022 Resolution is to learn Functional Programming and Distributed Systems.
