Software Engineer and Master\'s candidate in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania. I work on various toy projects with Rust.

At work I mainly use C# and C++, less frequently Python (mainly for scripting or data analysis).

Currently I'm taking Networked Systems class and learning Kotlin. I also write logs about Rust and other technologies on my [blog](https://www.bexxmodd.com/logs)

2022 Resolution is to learn Functional Programming, Kotlin, and get better hold of Distributed Systems.
